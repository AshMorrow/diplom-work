Здесь росли удивительные растения, обитали исполинские животные - мамонты, дейнотерии, южные слоны - всего 6 видов хоботных.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Одни гиганты приходили на смену другим, строение тела их видоизменялось. Другие виды могли "соседствовать". К примеру, мамонты и южные слоны обитали на территории нынешнего Запорожского края практически одновременно, хотя южный слон жил все же несколько позже - около 3 миллионов лет назад.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">- Одним из мест их массового скопления было Азовское побережье, - говорит палеонтолог Запорожского краеведческого музея Тамара Деркач. - Скорее всего, там у них были места водопоя. Со временем Азовское море разрушило берега и продолжает вымывать из толщи земли кости обитавших здесь когда-то животных.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Забор из костей мамонта</strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">В начале июня 1941 года палеонтологическая экспедиция Московского университета проводила раскопки в районе Азовского моря.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">- В один прекрасный момент после очередных безуспешных поисков на улочках рыбацкого поселка ученые обратили внимание на странно белеющие заборы, - рассказывает запорожский путешественник и краевед Владимир Супруненко. - Подошли ближе и глазам своим не поверили: вместо кольев в землю были врыты... огромные кости.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Местные жители, которых начали расспрашивать палеонтологи, не поняли такого любопытства приезжих, ведь для них такое "добро" было уж никак не в новинку. Они кивали в сторону моря: "Шукайте на березі. Там цього добра - збирай донесхочу".</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">- Ученые продолжили поиски на побережье, - говорит Владимир Супруненко. - Поиски увенчались успехом - море подарило палеонтологам скелет южного слона, обитавшего в этих краях более миллиона лет назад. К огромной радости ученых, это был самый полный и самый крупный скелет южного слона. Такого не было ни в одном музее мира.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Местные газеты тотчас сообщили о находке. Последняя публикация появилась в прессе за четыре дня до войны. В условиях надвигающейся угрозы было не до слона - то, что успели откопать на берегу Азовского моря, отправили в подвал местного краеведческого музея.</p>\r\n<table class="AImage" style="margin-bottom: 10px; width: 100%;" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="2" align="center">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="center" bgcolor="#ffffff">\r\n<table border="0" width="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="0">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><img style="margin: 4px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; height: 600px; width: 400px;" src="http://ki.ill.in.ua/a/675x0/24176237.jpg?t=636007521643682822" alt="" /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class="article-photo" align="center"><sub><strong>Украинский слон по сей день стоит в&nbsp;зоологическом музее Санкт-Петербурга. </strong> Фото: <a href="http://kp.ua/donsmaps.com">donsmaps.com</a></sub></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ценный груз</strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Фашистские войска вошли в Бердянск в октябре 1941 года. Чувствуя себя хозяевами захваченной территории, немецкие солдаты рыскали по городу в поисках ценностей. Так они наткнулись и на останки доисторического животного.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Диковинка вызвала немалый интерес у более образованных офицеров. Высшие чины тут же отправили телеграмму в Берлин. Ответ пришел молниеносно - скелет срочно переправить в Германию.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Ценность находки была столь велика, что появилось распоряжение - отыскать недостающие кости.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">- Зимой немцы согнали на побережье военнопленных, заставили вырубать мерзлую глину, - вспоминают старожилы. - Не успокоились, пока не нашли все косточки слона.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Части скелета упаковали с немецкой тщательностью и педантичностью, а ящики отправили в Берлин. Казалось, историческая ценность утеряна навсегда.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Лишь после победы скелет удалось вернуть в Советский Союз.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">- Собирая в Германии награбленные фашистами ценности, наткнулись и на так и оставшиеся не распакованными ящики с костями южного слона, - продолжает Владимир Супруненко. - Их привезли в Ленинград, но не хотели монтировать скелет до выяснения всех обстоятельств: откуда кости, как в Германию попали?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Лишь спустя какое-то время на глаза палеонтологам попалась статья о находке на Азовском побережье. Сопоставив факты, ученые убедились - перед ними тот самый скелет южного слона.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Путешествия слона на этом закончились. Скелет отреставрировали, смонтировали и выставили в мамонтовом зале зоологического музея Санкт-Петербурга.

(7, 1, 'Почему многоразовыми ракетами заинтересовались только сейчас?', '<p>Космическая ракета приближается к земле, выпуская дым и пламя, постепенно выравниваясь. Кажется, что она обречена. Но возле самой поверхности ее двигатели взвывают и ракета замедляется. Дым рассеивается и становится очевидно: она приземлилась. Вертикально. В целости и сохранности. Эпоха многоразовых космических аппаратов приближается. Некоторые фантасты мечтали об этом десятки лет назад.<img class="retina-dynamic aligncenter  wp-image-229640" title="SS2" src="http://hi-news.ru/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/p03wtzqh-650x260.jpg" alt="SS2" width="691" height="276" data-retina-src="http://hi-news.ru/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/p03wtzqh-1300x520.jpg" /> Почему так долго? Всего десять лет назад такое событие нельзя было и представить. Но после многих красочных и неудачных попыток посадить ракету, калифорнийская компания SpaceX за последние четыре месяца сделала это четырежды &mdash; один раз на суше в декабре 2015 на мысе Канаверал, а в апреле &mdash; впервые &mdash; на беспилотную баржу в середине Атлантического океана. И это были не холостые ракеты: обе сорокаметровые первые ступени ракет Falcon 9 вывели коммерческий космический аппарат на орбиту.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Возвращая ракетные ступени на Землю для повторного использования и починки, основатель SpaceX, миллиардер Элон Маск надеется сделать полеты в космос, наконец, экономически целесообразными, как коммерческая авиация. Его точка зрения такова: авиакомпании не выбрасывают Boeing 747 после каждого полета, почему мы так поступаем с космическими аппаратами? Научная фантастика предсказывала появление многоразовых космических аппаратов больше века, а космические инженеры экспериментировали с этой идеей с середины 20 века &mdash;&nbsp;частично многоразовый космический шаттл, вероятно, это лучшее, что удалось сделать. Почему же нормальные многоразовые космические корабли появляются только сейчас, когда уже столько денег было выброшено на ветер? <img class="retina-dynamic aligncenter  wp-image-229641" title="Ракета" src="http://hi-news.ru/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/p03wtzts-650x366.jpg" alt="Ракета" width="657" height="370" data-retina-src="http://hi-news.ru/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/p03wtzts-1300x731.jpg" /> Для начала стоит обратить особое внимание, что SpaceX &mdash; не единственная компания, которая этим занимается. Blue Origin при поддержке главы Amazon Джеффа Безоса запустила и приземлила ракету New Orbital три раза, каждый раз выходя за границу атмосферы (линию Кармана) на высоте 100 км. И SpaceShipTwo разработки Virgin Galactic также летал в суборбитальное пространство. &laquo;Небольшие транспортные средства, которые используют современные технологии, могут быть более пригодны для повторного использования, чем шаттлы, а суборбитальный транспорт &mdash; еще больше&raquo;, говорит CEO Virgin Джордж Уатйсайдс. И все же посадки SpaceX &mdash; это колоссальный технический подвиг.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Чтобы вывести спутник на низкую околоземную орбиту, ракета должна двигаться со скоростью около 6000 км/ч, а чтобы достичь геостационарной орбиты &mdash; 9000 км/ч, прежде чем первая ступень сможет отделиться и вернуться на Землю. &laquo;Суборбитальный транспорт летит прямо вверх и возвращается прямо вниз&raquo;, говорит Летиция Гэрриот де Кайе, американский космический предприниматель. &laquo;Несмотря на всю сложность затеи, скорость в верхней точки равна нулю, и тогда гравитация возвращает транспорт на Землю. Суборбитальная многоразовость сильно отличается по сложности от орбитальной многоразовости&raquo;, говорит она. <img class="retina-dynamic aligncenter  wp-image-229642" title="Airbus" src="http://hi-news.ru/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/p03wtzyt-650x366.jpg" alt="Airbus" width="657" height="370" data-retina-src="http://hi-news.ru/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/p03wtzyt-1300x731.jpg" /> Короче говоря, простое объяснение тому, что многоразовые ракеты появляются только сейчас, заключается в технической сложности. Но сама идея многоразовых космолетов уходит во времена еще до Второй мировой войны. До программы&nbsp;&laquo;Аполлон&raquo; космолеты считались будущим многоразовых космических аппаратов, говорит Роджер Лониус из Национального музея воздуха и космоса при Смитсоновском институте в Вашингтоне. &laquo;Эта идея витала в воздухе с тех пор, как Бак Роджерс и Флэш Гордон появились в комиксах в 1920-30-х годах.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Каждый космический корабль в этих комиксах был многоразовым космолетом. Поэтому до Второй мировой войны мы думали, что космические полеты будут похожи на обычное воздухоплавание&raquo;. После 1945 года захваченные немецкие ученые показали, что планировали &mdash;&nbsp;но так и не построили &mdash;&nbsp;суборбитальный космический самолет Silverbird, с помощью которого нацисты хотели разбомбить неприятеля. Новая особенность его конструкции заключалась в форме крыла, которая прибавляла аэродинамической подъемной силы. Эту идею взяли на вооружение ВВС США в 1958 году, когда начали работу над многоразовым крылатым космопланом X-20 Dyna-Soar &mdash; но лунная программа привела к консервации проекта в 1963 году. &laquo;Многоразовый космоплан был выброшен в окно из-за космической гонки, у которой была одна задача &mdash; обойти русских. В то же время космоплан был недостаточно развитой технологией для полетов на Луну&raquo;, говорит Лониус.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Больше внимания уделяли капсулам, которые запускались баллистически. &laquo;Капсулы повторного входа в атмосферу, которые использовались в ядерных боеголовках, по большей части были теми же, в которых посадили астронавтов. Просто меняете груз и все&raquo;. После триумфа &laquo;Аполлона&raquo;, впрочем, NASA вернулось к многоразовой первой любви: к крылатому многоразовому космоплану &mdash;&nbsp;космическому шаттлу. Пять шаттлов совершили в среднем по 27 миссий каждый; звездой флота был &laquo;Дискавери&raquo; с 39 миссиями. &laquo;Так что у космолетов длинная история многоразового использования&raquo;, говорит Марк Сиранджело, главный по космическим система в корпорации Sierra Nevada в Луисвилле, Колорадо. Недостаток был в том, что их приходилось ремонтировать между запусками &mdash;&nbsp;это касается и ракет SpaceX. Хотя SpaceX испытала, могут ли ее ракеты вернуться на Землю, она еще не починила ни одной. И в этом и заключается ее настоящее испытание, считает Лониус. &laquo;Если вы сможете использовать повторно любую часть космического аппарата, вы сэкономите деньги на следующем запуске. Но если вам придется разбирать и полностью ремонтировать его перед каждым рейсом, вы с таким же успехом можете построить новый&raquo;. <img class="retina-dynamic aligncenter  wp-image-229643" title="Шаттл" src="http://hi-news.ru/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/p03wty5j-650x366.jpg" alt="Шаттл" width="657" height="370" data-retina-src="http://hi-news.ru/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/p03wty5j-1300x731.jpg" /> NASA также проводило исследования гораздо меньших многоразовых КЛА, которые сейчас появляются в других ипостасях. Например, NASA X37 сейчас используется ВВС США в форме X37B, беспилотного ракетного космоплана, который осуществляет секретные военные миссии на низкой околоземной орбите и возвращается самостоятельно домой. Космоплан NASA HL-20, разработанный в конце 80-х и 90-х в качестве потенциальной шлюпки космической станции, был приобретен Sierra Nevada и переименован в Dream Chaser. Компания превратила проект NASA в то, что Сиранджело называет &laquo;мощнейшим многоразовым транспортом&raquo;, который она может сделать.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Потребовалось заменить фюзеляж NASA из металлического сплава на продвинутый легковесный композит&raquo;. &laquo;Он будет намного прочнее и больше приспособлен к стрессам космического полета, давлениям и температурам&raquo;, говорит Сиранджело. В дополнение к грузовым перелетам NASA, Dream Chaser &mdash;&nbsp;который можно запустить с любой современной ракетой и посадить на любой аэропорт, способный принять Airbus A320 &mdash; рассматривает ЕКА и немецкая лаборатория DLR для различных миссий.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">К примеру, для захвата и удаления космического мусора. Хотя космоплан выглядит наиболее логичным способом создать многоразовый космический аппарат, свет увидели и другие более диковинные конструкции. Например, Roton производства Rotary Rocket Company, капсула в форме перечницы, проходила испытания в 1999 году с целью исправить проблему, с которой сотни космических экипажей столкнулись во время возвращения на Землю с начала космической гонки: они не могли приземлиться, где хотели, и были вынуждены предоставить себя парашютам. <img class="retina-dynamic aligncenter  wp-image-229644" title="Dream Chaser" src="http://hi-news.ru/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/p03wv009-650x366.jpg" alt="Dream Chaser" width="657" height="370" data-retina-src="http://hi-news.ru/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/p03wv009-1300x731.jpg" /> В Rotary Rocket хотели дать экипажу возможность выбирать, где его капсула должна осуществить мягкую посадку, в результате чего транспортное средство, очевидно, можно было бы использовать повторно. Для этого оно должно было повторно войти в атмосферу и оказавшись в толще воздуха развернуть вертолетные роторы. Ракетные двигатели на кончиках винтов должны были заработать на определенной высоте и экипаж мог бы направить свою вертолетную капсулу к выбранной точке посадки. К сожалению, у Rotary Rocket Company кончились деньги до того, как они смогли зайти достаточно далеко. NASA однажды тоже рассматривало роторы, но отказалось от варианта с ракетным движением, предпочтя авторотацию для своей капсулы &laquo;Орион&raquo;. Нестандартный подход Roton может частично жить, благодаря SpaceX.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Семиместная капсула Dragon V2, которая разрабатывается для поездок NASA на МКС, должна стать в итоге многоразовой, благодаря восьми ракетным двигателям, встроенным в ее внешние стенки. У них будет две задачи: выбрасывать капсулу с экипажем, если ракета взрывается во время запуска, и включаться для мягкой активной посадки. Первоначальные приземления с Dragon V2 будут осуществляться&nbsp;с помощью традиционного сброса с парашютом в океан, а потом последует и активное приземление. Американская ракетная компания United Launch Alliance &mdash; совместное предприятие Boeing и Lockheed Martin &mdash; изучает, как можно было бы отбросить большущий и дорогущий ракетный двигатель в основе будущей ракеты Vulcan и заставить его приземлиться на параплане, чтобы потом восстановить. ULA также планирует оставлять на орбите вторую ступень, которая будет ожидать заправки для различных задач, например, для обслуживания спутников.</p>\r\n<p>Французская Airbus изучает, как ракетный двигатель в основе будущей ракеты Ariane 6 мог бы использовать крылья и небольшие реактивные двигатели для самостоятельного возвращения в аэропорт. Китайское космическое агентство говорит о планах повторно использовать ступени ракеты &laquo;Великий поход&raquo; (&lsquo;Long March&rsquo;, &laquo;Великий поход китайских коммунистов&raquo;), используя множество парашютов. Все это имеет смысл, говорит Уайтсайдс. &laquo;Грядет множество поколений многоразовых космических аппаратов. Пионеры в лице SpaceShipOne, Falcon 9, New Shepard и X-37B ВВС США оставят потомков самых разных форм и сдержат обещание кардинально снизить расходы на орбитальный запуск&raquo;</p>', 'default', 'наука,техника,космос', 1, '05-06-2016', 0),
(8, 1, 'Загадка происхождения Луны', '<p>По результатам компьютерного моделирования ученые пришли к выводу, что Луна образовалась в результате столкновения Земли с очень похожей на нее планетой.</p>\r\n<p>Загадка происхождения Луны уже долгое время не дает покоя ученым. Основная гипотеза &mdash; т.н. гипотеза &laquo;большого столкновения&raquo;, согласно которой Луна сформировалась из обломков, образовавшихся в результате столкновения Земли с другой планетой (эту гипотетическую планету называют Тейей &mdash; по имени древнегреческой богини Тейи, матери Селены, богини Луны), что произошло примерно 4,5 млрд. лет назад. В те времена на Земле не было ни воды, ни жизни, а сама она напоминала адский объект, который покрывала раскаленная лава и которую без конца бомбили астероиды. Эта гипотеза хорошо объясняет основные свойства Луны, в частности его массу и отсутствие крупного железного ядра.</p>\r\n<p>Из гипотезы &laquo;большого столкновения&raquo; следует, что Луна должна быть образована преимущественно из материала ударного тела &mdash; Теий. Однако лунная и земная порода очень похожи. Отсюда можно сделать вывод, что Земля и гипотетическая Тейя должны быть очень похожими между собой. Их параметры должны быть ближе, чем параметры любых двух тел в Солнечной системе. Но это противоречило статистике, согласно которой вероятность существования таких подобных тел в Солнечной системе не должна превышать 1%. А это &laquo;невероятно редко&raquo;, &mdash; сообщает Робин Кэнап, планетолог из Юго-Восточного исследовательского института в Боулдере (Колорадо).</p>\r\n<p>Теперь же ученые убеждены, что эти данные &mdash; ложные. Хага Перец, астрофизик из Израильского института технологий в Хайфе, вместе с коллегами провел компьютерное моделирование процессов на орбите Земли в ранней Солнечной системе, чтобы установить, насколько похожими должны быть Земля и гипотетическая Тейя, чтобы сформировать при столкновении Луну. В итоге они получили возможность на уровне 20-40%. А это &mdash; достаточно высокий результат, чтобы считать Землю и Тейю &laquo;планетами-сестрами&raquo;. Результаты исследования опубликованы в Nature.</p>\r\n<p>Ученые объясняют: Земля и Тейя были похожими, ведь сформировались на практически одинаковом расстоянии от Солнца и из одинакового протопланетного материала. &laquo;Земля и Луна, &mdash; резюмирует Перец &mdash; это не близнецы, которые родились от одной и той же планеты, а скорее сестры, выросшие в одной и той же среде&raquo;, &mdash; утверждает Перец.</p>', 'default', 'земля,луна,планета', 1, '05-06-2016', 0),

Однако порой то, что начинается благими намерениями, на деле заканчивается страданиями миллионов людей. Сегодня мы расскажем о пяти гениях, которые сильно пожалели о своих изобретениях.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Альфред Нобель: динамит</strong></p>\r\n<p align="center"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-229596" title="184854072" src="http://hi-news.ru/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/184854072.jpg" alt="184854072" width="1200" /></p>\r\n<p>Нобель был выдающимся шведским химиком, изобретателем и инженером. Уже в возрасте 17 лет он свободно разговаривал на 5 языках. Сегодня его знают как создателя Нобелевской премии &mdash; награды для тех, кто в течение года принес человечеству наибольшую пользу. Идея награды появилась у Нобеля благодаря его собственному изобретению &mdash; динамиту, который был запатентован в 1867 году.</p>\r\n<p>Разрабатывая взрывчатку, Нобель стремился создать более стабильную форму нитроглицерина, который в свое время убил младшего брата изобретателя. Нобель считал, что его детище положит конец войне.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&laquo;Возможно, мои заводы остановят войны раньше, чем это сделают политики. Когда два армейских корпуса смогут уничтожить друг друга в одно мгновение, все развитые страны похолодеют от ужаса и расформируют свои армии&raquo;, &mdash; мечтал Нобель.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Однако на практике военные быстро оценили возможности динамита и с радостью приняли его на вооружение. Динамит уничтожил так много людей, что одна французская газета сообщила о смерти изобретателя как о радостным событии:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&laquo;Le marchand de la mort est mort (Торговец смертью мертв)&raquo;, &mdash; возвестило издание.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Нобель очень переживал, что его детище стало причиной гибели огромного числа людей. Вот почему он передал большую часть наследства на учреждение Премии мира.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Артур Галстон: агент оранж</strong></p>\r\n<p align="center"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-229597" title="528102684" src="http://hi-news.ru/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/528102684.jpg" alt="528102684" width="1200" /></p>\r\n<p>Артур Галстон &mdash; американский ботаник, искавший методы ускорения роста ценных культур. Ученый занимался синтезом дихлорфеноксиуксусной кислоты &mdash; вещества, ускоряющего плодоношение соевых бобов. Однако коллеги Галстона использовали его наработки для создания химического оружия. Созданный ими химикат получил название &laquo;агент оранж&raquo; и был использован во время войны во Вьетнаме для уничтожения вражеских посевов. Вещество оказалось эффективным. Как выяснилось позже, агент оранж оказался причиной врожденных дефектов у сотен тысяч детей и проблем со здоровьем у огромного количества взрослых.</p>\r\n<p>Галстон выразил протест против такого использования своей разработки. Ученый боролся за запрет агента оранж с 1965 по 1971 год, когда, наконец, химикат был изъят из оборота.</p>\r\n<p>Галстон не считал себя виновным в последствиях использования вещества, ведь он не принимал решения о применении агента оранж на войне.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&laquo;Занимаясь наукой, вы не знаете, как будут использованы плоды вашего творчества. Любое открытие является нейтральным с моральной точки зрения. Люди могут использовать его как для благих, так и для разрушительных целей. Это не вина науки&raquo;, &mdash; сказал Галстон в интервью The New York Times.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p><strong>Михаил Калашников: АК-47</strong></p>\r\n<p align="center"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-229598" title="562579175" src="http://hi-news.ru/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/562579175.jpg" alt="562579175" width="1200" /></p>\r\n<p>Все, что хотел Калашников, &mdash; защитить свою страну. С этой мыслью он отправился на военную службу. Не раз будущему изобретателю приходилось слышать жалобы товарищей на ненадежные и опасные в использовании винтовки, находившиеся на вооружении у Советской Армии. Соединив интерес к оружию и инженерный талант, Калашников создал свое главное детище &mdash; автомат, получивший наименование АК-47.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&laquo;Это самое популярное и эффективное огнестрельное оружие в мире. Его конструкция настолько проста, что во многих странах автомат стоит дешевле, чем живой цыпленок&raquo;, &mdash; пишет Washington Post.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Автомат Калашникова дешев в производстве, легок, прочен и пригоден для использования в любых климатических условиях. Будучи удостоенным звания Героя России, Калашников всю жизнь гордился заслугами перед страной.</p>\r\n<p>К сожалению, многие террористические группы наладили кустарное производство АК-47. Попадание оружия на службу преступников огорчало изобретателя.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&laquo;Я горжусь своим изобретением, но мне грустно, что его используют террористы. Если бы у меня был выбор, я бы предпочел изобрести какое-нибудь полезное устройство для фермеров, например, газонокосилку&raquo;, &mdash; рассказал Калашников The Guardian.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Из ста миллионов АК-47, произведенных к 2009 году, половина была изготовлена в подпольных условиях. Создатель автомата был настолько угнетен этим фактом, что написал письмо главе Русской Православной Церкви.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&laquo;Моя душевная боль невыносима. Я мучаюсь вопросом: если моя винтовка убивает людей, несу ли я ответственность за их смерть?&raquo; &mdash; спрашивал Калашников у Патриарха.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Церковь сняла с изобретателя вину и поблагодарила за службу, а спустя полгода Калашников скончался.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Орвилл Райт: самолет</strong></p>\r\n<p align="center"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-229599" title="bomber" src="http://hi-news.ru/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/bomber.jpg" alt="bomber" width="1200" /></p>\r\n<p>Все слышали о том, как Орвилл и Уилбур Райт изобрели и построили первый самолет, а затем поднялись на нем в воздух. Всю жизнь пропагандируя использование авиации в мирных целях, Райты не ожидали увидеть, как плоды их творчества применяются в качестве оружия.</p>\r\n<p>Братья продавали самолеты армии США, но считали что крылатые машины будут использоваться военными только для наблюдения за противником. Переживший Первую мировую войну Орвилл понял, какие разрушения приносит использование военной авиации.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&laquo;Самолет сделал войну настолько ужасной, что я не верю, что какая-либо страна снова захочет развязать конфликт&raquo;, &mdash; писал он в Совет авиационной промышленности.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&laquo;Самолет, сделавший возможности по разрушению безграничными, фактически стал гарантией мира&raquo;, &mdash; сказал Орвилл Райт, выступая спустя пять лет на радио.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Однако, увидев последствия авиабомбардировок во время Второй мировой войны, Райт, наконец, осознал, что авиация лишь приумножила число погибших людей и пожалел о своем изобретении.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&laquo;Мы хотели создать то, что обеспечит мир на Земле. Но мы ошибались&raquo;, &mdash; заявил Райт в предсмертном интервью.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p><strong>Роберт Оппенгеймер: атомная бомба</strong></p>\r\n<p align="center"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-229608" title="hqdefaul" src="http://hi-news.ru/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/hqdefaul.jpg" alt="hqdefaul" width="1200" /></p>\r\n<p>Хорошо известно, что Эйнштейн пожалел о своем участии в создании атомной бомбы. Однако физик-теоретик не принимал непосредственного участия в конструировании и постройке сверхмощного оружия.</p>\r\n<p>Во время второй мировой войны другой ученый &mdash; Юлиус Роберт Оппенгеймер понял, что создание атомной бомбы может положить конец военному противостоянию. Работая в Лос-аламосской лаборатории, Оппенгеймер изучал цепные реакции быстрых нейтронов, необходимые для атомного взрыва.</p>\r\n<p>Поняв, насколько страшной силой обладает ядерное оружие, Оппенгеймер стал настаивать на введении международного контроля над использованием атомной энергии. В результате физик был назначен председателем Генерального консультативного комитета Комиссии по атомной энергии.</p>\r\n<p>Оппенгеймер решительно протестовал против производства все новых атомных бомб, но из-за контактов ученого с коммунистами правительство усомнилось в его благонадежности. В результате Оппенгеймеру пришлось свернуть антиядерную агитацию. Использование атомных бомб и угроза ядерной войны угнетали ученого до конца его дней.</p>\r\n</div>', 'default', 'Гениальные изобретения,Изобретения,Открытия', 1, '05-06-2016', 0);
